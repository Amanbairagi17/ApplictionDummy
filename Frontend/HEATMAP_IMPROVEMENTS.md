# Heatmap and Responsiveness Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Heatmap Calendar Alignment** ✅
- **Problem**: Heatmap was not properly representing a calendar year structure
- **Solution**: Implemented proper week-based grid system
- **Changes**: 
  - Each column now represents a week (7 days)
  - Each row represents a day of the week
  - Proper alignment with actual calendar structure
  - Empty cells for days before the start date to maintain week alignment

### 2. **Question Line Overflow** ✅
- **Problem**: Long text was overflowing outside the dashboard boundaries
- **Solution**: Added responsive text sizing and proper word wrapping
- **Changes**:
  - Added `break-words` class to prevent text overflow
  - Responsive text sizes: `text-sm sm:text-base`
  - Proper container sizing with `max-w-full`

### 3. **Responsiveness Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Dashboard was not properly responsive on mobile devices
- **Solution**: Implemented mobile-first responsive design
- **Changes**:
  - Added responsive padding: `p-4 sm:p-6`
  - Responsive margins: `mb-6 sm:mb-8`
  - Responsive text sizes throughout
  - Responsive grid layouts
  - Mobile-optimized heatmap cell sizes: `w-2 h-2 sm:w-3 sm:h-3`

## Technical Improvements

### Heatmap Component (`ActivityHeatmap.jsx`)
```javascript
// New calendar grid generation
const generateCalendarGrid = () => {
  const grid = [];
  const today = new Date();
  const startDate = new Date(today);
  startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() - 364);
  
  let currentDate = new Date(startDate);
  let week = [];
  
  // Add empty cells for proper week alignment
  const startDay = startDate.getDay();
  for (let i = 0; i < startDay; i++) {
    week.push(null);
  }
  
  // Generate 365 days in proper week structure
  for (let day = 0; day < 365; day++) {
    // ... day generation logic
    if (week.length === 7) {
      grid.push(week);
      week = [];
    }
  }
  
  return grid;
};
```

### Responsive Design Updates
- **Container**: `px-2 sm:px-4` for responsive horizontal padding
- **Cards**: `p-4 sm:p-6` for responsive card padding
- **Text**: `text-xl sm:text-2xl` for responsive headings
- **Spacing**: `space-y-3 sm:space-y-4` for responsive vertical spacing
- **Grid**: Responsive grid layouts that adapt to screen size

### CSS Improvements
```css
/* Removed custom grid class */
/* Added responsive heatmap styling */
.heatmap-container {
    overflow-x: auto;
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

/* Custom scrollbar for better UX */
.heatmap-container::-webkit-scrollbar {
    height: 8px;
}
```
